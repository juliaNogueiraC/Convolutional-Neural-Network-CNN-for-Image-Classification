# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-Image-Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images as either dogs or cats. The CNN is trained on a dataset containing thousands of images of dogs and cats to learn to distinguish between the two classes.
