# Convolutional Neural Network CNN for Image Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images as either dogs or cats. The CNN is trained on a dataset containing thousands of images of dogs and cats to learn to distinguish between the two classes.

## Main Features
- Image Preprocessing: Images are resized and normalized to improve model performance.

- CNN Architecture: Utilizes a convolutional network architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers for classification.

- Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using the training set and evaluated using the test set to measure classification accuracy.
